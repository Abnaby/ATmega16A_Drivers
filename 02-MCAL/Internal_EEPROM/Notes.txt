Write Operation :

1. Wait till previous write operation is completed(i.e. wait till EEWE becomes zero).

2. Load the EEPROM address into EEAR at which the data has to be stored.

3. Load the data into EEDR which has to be stored in EEPROM.

4. Set the EEMWE (EEPROM Master Write Enable).

5. Within four clock cycles after 4th step, set EEWE(Eeprom Write Enable) to trigger the EEPROM Write Opeartion 

Read Operation :
1. WAit for completion of previous Write operation.

2. EEWE will be cleared once EEPROM write is completed.

3. Load the EEPROM address into EEAR from where the data needs to be read.

4. Trigger the EEPROM read operation by setting EERE (EEPROM Read Enable).

5. Wait for some time (about 1ms) and collect the read data from EEDR. 



When the EEPROM is read, the CPU is halted for four clock cycles before the next instruction is executed.
When the EEPROM is written, the CPU is halted for two clock cycles before the next instruction is executed
